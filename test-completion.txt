# OpenCode Webhook Test

This file was created to test the new agent completion notification system.

## What Just Happened

The OpenCode agent completed a task (creating this file), which should trigger:

1. A mobile notification on your iPhone
2. A persistent notification in Home Assistant with full details
3. A logbook entry

## Payload Details

The webhook sent includes:
- Session title (likely the project folder name "opencode-webhooks")
- This complete message text
- Token usage statistics
- Cost information
- Timestamp

## Expected Results

You should receive a notification that says something like:
- **Title**: "OpenCode: opencode-webhooks"
- **Message**: "I'll create a simple test file to demonstrate the new webhook functionality!..."

Check your Home Assistant notifications for the full message!
